# Devcontainer Quick Start

This devcontainer is pre-configured for Azure Communication Services Virtual Visits development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Dependencies**: Already installed automatically when the container was created
2. **Start Development**: Run the following command to start both client and server in development mode:

```bash
cd client && npm run start:project
```

This will:
- Start the server on port 8080 (Express/Node.js)
- Start the client on port 3000 (React/webpack-dev-server) 
- Enable hot reload for both client and server
- Open the app at `http://localhost:3000`

## üîß Environment Variables

To fully use the application, you'll need to configure environment variables. See the main [README.md](../README.md#environment-variables) for details.
